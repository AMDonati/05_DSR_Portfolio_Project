## Modelling Parkinson Disease Progression with Machine Learning

#### This project was my portfolio project work when being a student at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/), from August to Sept, 11th 2018. 

#### It was presented at a Community Day on Sept 11th, 2018 but it's still an on-going project.
That's why the code is under Jupyter notebooks format. Please notice also that the code is not completely clean.
The final files will be of course converted into .py files, and will be made completely reproducible. 

#### README in construction: meanwhile, please check the [slides of the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JYOB0iaeFfNAEunfd2n1ss4aXawDhqgnOqQDEpzDVks/edit#slide=id.g40eea364a6_2_229)
