### 1. Abstract / Project objectives:
The main goal of this project is predicting Parkinson Disease (PD) Progression over time for a set of patients from a clinical study.

More precisely, the project objectives are:
Starting from a dataset of Electronic Health Records of patients with 4 different clinical diagnosis (PD diagnosed patients, 400 de novo PD subjects - newly diagnosed and unmedicated, SWEDD and healthy control subjects),I will:
* **Classify clinical diagnosis for each patient**
* **Predict Parkinson Disease Progression over time** using:  
   * 2a. First, only biological biomarkers . 
   * 2b. Add in a second time MRI data (raw brain scans from the PPMI dataset) . 
 (the idea is to compare the performance of the models with and without MRI data, as performing MRI is expensive for hospitals and also not easy to process as data).
* **Predict best treatment strategy associated to each patient and each future disease state**
* If enough time: **_predicting patients' time of death_** (see recent article about Google having done such predictions)
* If enough time: **_ANALYZE TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF BIOMARKERS USING LONGITUDINAL STABILITY SELECTION_**
(as done on AD in Fused Sparse Group Lasso Paper)

_NB: SWEDD= Scans without evidence of dopamine deficit: patients who look like they have PD in terms of symptom but subsequent functional imaging assessment does not confirm this._

### 3. DS main challenges for this project: 
* Multi-modal (dataframes + MRI scans) multi-label classification problem of timeseries with features selection depending on the label prediction (the PD predominant biomarkers are depending on the disease state)


### 4. Use cases: 
* **FOR DOCTORS**: 
   * Early detection of PD subjects
   * Improving disease accuracy, 
   * Anticipation of their patients' disease evolution
   * support to decision for choosing treatments for patients
* **FOR PD PATIENTS**: 
  * For people with risk of getting PD: early detection and monitoring 
  * For early-stage/late-stage PD people: monitoring better their disease by knowing the expected evolution
  * Finding the best treatment that will improve the quality of life of PD people
* **FOR HOSPITALS**: 
 * cost reductions by improved patient management & treatment optimization
 * operations improvement by predicting patients future visits, med supplies, etc...
  
### 5.DS Process for the project 
1. **Data Processing/Cleaning**: Merge/Join of Tables (eventually using PyTables)

2. **EDA**: 
* timeseries analysis & plotting
> look @ sparsity, irregularity... 
* Look @ numbers of subjects having DatScan (MRI) data
* Look @ Study Enrollment data

3.**Feature Engineering:** (if classic ML is used)
  * Manual Feature Engineering with the help of doctors 
  * Statistical techniques to find correlation between features
  * Classic Feature Engineering Techniques for ML 
  * Special Feature Engineering techniques/ embeddings methods for DL methods
  
4. **ML/DL models to try:** 
 * Baseline: ? - see with Gerrit 
 
 * "Explainable" models: gradient-boosted trees, Random Forest - see with Gerrit 
> Issue of large numbers of features for these models though...

 * DL Models to be modified to include incertainty with bayesian models
    * Hidden Markov Models
    * RNN
    * LSTM
    ...
  
  > NB: maybe the problem of allocating treatments to disease states over time could be solved by reinforcement learning as well... See these links:

6. **Outputs of the model** . 
For each patient: 
* a vector of disease states for different timestamps (multiple labels for each timestamp corresponding to UPDRS scale) . 
> link to UPDRS scale: UPDRS: http://www.etas.ee/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/updrs.pdf
* The associated treatment strategy related to the disease state (multiple labels as well)
* The estimated time of death 

7. **Data Visualisation to present the results** . 
Plots comparating the performance of the different models for different metrics
