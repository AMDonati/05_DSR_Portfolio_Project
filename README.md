# Parkinson Disease Project - ideas of precise topics
## _Objective: Defining the precise topic on the week of July 16th_

### **MAIN DATASET**: http://www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/download-data/
#### study pop:
* 400 de novo PD subjects - newly diagnosed & unmedicamented
* 200 age and gender matched healthy controls
* ~70-80 SWEDD subjects
> Subjects followed for a min of 3 years, and a max of 5 years. 
#### Clinical data collection: 
* Motor Assessments
* Neuropsychiatric/neurobehavioral testing
* Olfaction
* DatScan Imaging, MRI

## 1. Building a recommender system suggesting the best treatment(s) for each PD subject
### AI & Healthcare topic: precision medicine
#### use cases:
* **For Doctors**: decision support tool for selecting the best treament for each of their patients
* **For Patients/Patients Families**: Improved quality of life due to a more "personalised" treatment
* **For Researchers looking for new PD treatments**: Tool that could give them a better understanding of the pros/cons & efficiency of each treatment, and their suitability for each PD's "subject type"

#### Data Science Challenges / Techniques: 
* Database building to gather all the subjects' information in one table
* Feature Engineering to select the relevant set of features to be used for the recommender system model
* Statistical techniques to select the features (correlation...)
* Machine Learning Techniques (Clustering, Classification), probably using gradient boosted trees and random forest classifier. 
* Recommender System Building

#### Potential difficulties of this topic: 
-Doing correctly the feature engineering to select the right variables to use as an input of the recommender system
> Requires domaine expertise

## 2. Building a prediction model for predicting the evolution of the disease for each subject 
### AI & Healthcare topic: diagnosis prediction/accuracy 
#### use cases: 
* FOR DOCTORS: Early detection of PD subjects, anticipation of their patients' disease evolution.
* FOR PD PATIENTS: 
  * For people with risk of getting PD: early detection and monitoring 
  * For early-stage/late-stage PD people: monitoring better their disease by knowing the expected evolution
  
#### Data Science Challenges / Techniques: 
* Database building to gather all the subjects' information in one table
* Feature Engineering to select the relevant set of features to be used as input for the prediction model
* Statistical techniques to select the features (correlation...)
* Machine Learning Techniques (Regression), probably using linear regression with L1/L2 regularization, random forest(regression version) and linear neural networks.  
* Data Visualisation Tools to present the results


#### Additonal datasets that could be used: 
* Same as topic #1 

#### Potential difficulties of this topic:
-Doing correctly the feature engineering to select the right variables to use as an input of the prediction model
> Requires domaine expertise
* Definition/Classification of the different stages of the disease (as prediction outputs) can be quite complicated


## 3. Specific focus on brain scans analysis of PD subjects 
### AI & Healthcare topic: biomedical vision / CAD for neuroimaging  
#### use cases:
