##### 4. Dataset 4
[Parkinson Disease Spiral Drawings Using Digitized Graphics Tablet](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson+Disease+Spiral+Drawings+Using+Digitized+Graphics+Tablet#)  

**Short Description:**  
The PD and control handwriting database consists of 62 PWP (People with parkinson) and 15 healthy individuals.    From all subjects, three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST), Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken.  
Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression.
