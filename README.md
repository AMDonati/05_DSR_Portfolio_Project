## Modelling Parkinson Disease Progression with Machine Learning

#### This project was my portfolio project work when being a student at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/), from August to Sept, 11th 2018. 
#### It was presented at a Community Day 

#### But it still an on-going project 
That's why the code is under Jupyter notebooks format. The final files will be of course 
converted into .py files, and will be completely reproducible. 

#### README in construction: meanwhile, please check the [slides of the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JYOB0iaeFfNAEunfd2n1ss4aXawDhqgnOqQDEpzDVks/edit#slide=id.g40eea364a6_2_229)
