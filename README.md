# Parkinson Disease Project - DSR
## Subject: A Probabilistic Model to predict the future states of the disease progress of Parkinson among a population of patients
## AI & Healthcare topic: diagnosis prediction/accuracy

### 0. Project context
* **number of hours to work on it**: ~350-400h 
* **Project output**: 
 * Github repo with reproducible code
 * Oral Presentation (~20min) in front of panel of companies and data scientists in Berlin 
 * Slides Deck
 * _Optional_: Video about the Project Process, Medium Article, Scientific paper (if relevant)

### 1. **MAIN DATASET**:

![Data Summary](https://github.com/AMDonati/parkinson-disease-project/blob/master/PPMI%20data%20summary.png)


### 2. Use cases: 
* **FOR DOCTORS**: Early detection of PD subjects, Improving disease accuracy, anticipation of their patients' disease evolution 
* **FOR PD PATIENTS**: 
  * For people with risk of getting PD: early detection and monitoring 
  * For early-stage/late-stage PD people: monitoring better their disease by knowing the expected evolution
  
### 3. Data Science Techniques to be used: 
1. **Data Processing/Cleaning**: Merge/Join of Tables (eventually using PyTables), filling missing values

2.**Feature Engineering:**
  * Manual Feature Engineering with the help of doctors 
  * Statistical techniques to find correlation between features
  * Classic Feature Engineering Techniques 
  
3. **ML/DL models to try:** 
 * Baseline: Naive-Bayes Classifier, 
 
 
 * "Explainable" models: gradient-boosted trees, Random Forest
> Issue of large numbers of features for these models though...

 * DL Models to be modified to include incertainty with bayesian models (_litterature on the subject to be read_)
  * Hidden Markov Models
  * RNN
  * LSTM
  ...
  
4. **Outputs of the model**
For each patient subject: a vector of tuples (PD state (categorical variable), probability) for each period of time considered
> Think more in depth about the relevant output (talk with the doctors)

5. **Interactive DataViz Tools to present the results**
> Check all the tools available and select the best one. 

6. **[if enough time]: do some CV on the MRI scans**

### 4. DS tools to be used (Python Libraries, API...): 
_TO COMPLETE_

### 5. Potential Challenges raised by the subject
* Doing correctly the feature engineering to select the right variables to use as an input of the prediction model
* Definition/Classification of the different stages of the disease (as prediction outputs) can be quite complicated:
